# yoprog

Hello. This is my first Go project. It took me a while to figure out the multiple source files and importing procedures, but I finally sat down and hashed it out. This is the result. It's mainly a study of the aforementioned local package particulars and function features. Hopefully I'll come back to it every now in then because this is the modern language that I'm most interested in until some site like codecaemy adds a Zig course or there's a book published on it.

## How to Run

If you're also new to Go, this part is easy. Once go is installed, copy this repository to your source folder (or any folder of your choice), and then run ```go run yoprog```. It's that easy!
